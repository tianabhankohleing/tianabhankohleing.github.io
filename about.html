            Thank you for taking your time to explore my portfolio! I tried to make it as interactive as my skills would allow me, try hovering over the small cat in the structure and see what it says! Everything here as of now is original work, except for the background!

            I am Tiana Bhankohleing, a student in the Web Design and Graphic Design program at Southwest Career and Technical Academy. I specialize in mainly art aspects, such as drawing, and designing. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In the future I would like to major in animation if possible. I do a lot of writing and drawing in my free time, I would like to master every aspect in animation. Besides animation, I would also like to create games, which has the animation aspect in it. This is not what I am currently majoring in, but I believe that I will be able to put the skills I've learned in web design to use, even while persuing a different path.
